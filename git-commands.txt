Basic Git Workflow

Git is the industry-standard version control system for web developers

Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:

create a new Git repository
$ git init
 
inspect the contents of the working directory and staging area
$git status 

add files from the working directory to the staging area
$ git add (filename)

stages all changes
$ git add -A 

stages new files and modifications, without deletions
$ git add . 

stages modifications and deletions, without new files
$ git add -u 

show the difference between the working directory and the staging area
$ git diff
 
permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
$ git commit -m "Comment"

shows a list of all previous commits
$ git log

pus commit to github repository
$ git push -u origin master
